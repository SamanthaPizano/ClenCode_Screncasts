# Clean Code

Screen casts from the [Clean Code](https://cleancoders.com/) series.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo. Switch to the branch with a corresponding screen cast:

* [testable-html](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/testable-html) - [Testable Html](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-1-testable-html). This is the first of three screencasts for Clean Code Episode 3: Functions. The focus in this cast is on small functions and refactoring technique.
* [prime-generator](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/prime-generator) - [Prime Generator](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-2-prime). In this screencast, Uncle Bob refactors the famous Prime Number Generator from Donald Knuth's landmark book, Literate Programming. This screencast focuses on finding multiple classes buried within single, long functions.
* [video-store](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/video-store) - [Video Store](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-3-videostore). This is the famous "Video Store" example from Martin Fowler's book, Refactoring. In this screencast, Uncle Bob takes it apart one step at a time. In the end, he will transform this code from a single large function in a group of otherwise empty classes, into a nicely partitioned object oriented design.
